Instructions for task 2 python code

First I load the data which is a csv file named 'orders.csv'.
Then I check for Nan values and the data type of each column.
I calculate frequency and order value and then merge my results with the initial dataframe.
I define custom thresholds for frequency and order value and I assign segments based on the thresholds.
Finally I make visualizations showing insights about the marketing campaign, which will be later used for the presentation.
