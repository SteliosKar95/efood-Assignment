Instructions for efood Task 2 RFM python code

First I load the data which is a csv file named 'orders.csv'.
Then I check for Nan values and the data type of each column.
I make RFM Analysis and define segments.
Finally I make visualizations showing insights about the marketing campaign, which will be later used for the presentation.
